## Focus on Design
As this point in the course, the group began to focus on the details and implementation of the solution chosen from the design selection matrix.

### Software and Controls 
An initial high level design was created as shown below to visualize the data flow and to see how the different components (client, server, iot devices) talk to each other.

At this point, no real work had been done on the software end and justifications are still needed for the design. For example, why did we choose a relational SQL database? Why did we use MQTT and Web Sockets?

### Circuits

### Mechanical Design

### Sensors and Actuators
