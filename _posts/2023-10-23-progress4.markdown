## PDP - Preliminary Design Presentation 
For this week, the group focused on creating and presenting the PDP. The PDP required the following for the presentation:
- Need
- Goal and Objectives
- Specifications
- Constraints and Criteria
- Alternate Design Solutions
- Patent Search (at least 3 patents) – Relative merits and demerits
– Is your design Patentable?
- Design Selection Matrix

The first 5 topics including the design selection matrix were already addressed incrementally throughout the previous weeks. So besides, formatting and making a presentation, the only new thing that had to be done was the patent search.
