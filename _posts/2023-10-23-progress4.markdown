## PDP - Preliminary Design Presentation 
For this week, the group focused on creating and presenting the PDP. The PDP required the following for the presentation:
- Need
- Goal and Objectives
- Specifications
- Constraints and Criteria
- Alternate Design Solutions
- Patent Search (at least 3 patents) – Relative merits and demerits
– Is your design Patentable?
- Design Selection Matrix

The first 5 topics including the design selection matrix were already addressed incrementally throughout the previous weeks. So besides, formatting and making a presentation, the only new thing that had to be done was the patent search. 

### Patent Search
- System and Method for Sleep Environment Management is a system that can analyze a user's sleep data such as sleep stages, hypnograms, sleep scores, mind recharge scores and body scores via sensors such as non-contact motion sensors. It also contains sensors to detect and collect data of the environment such as brightness, temperature and air quality.

- Sleep enhancement in an hvac system is a system that is connected to the user’s house hvac system. Which can adjust the timing of the temperature profile is advanced to cause room temperature to decrease before the natural decrease in body temperature is expected to occur, thereby helping lead a person into sleep without the use of pharmaceuticals or other artificial sleeping aids.
