## Problem Formulation 

Because of group conflicts, we were a bit late with getting to the problem formulation. In our first meeting with Professor Dr. Tung, we proposed two main problems space for our capstone project:

1. **Sleep tracking device to correlate sleep quality and environmental conditions**. This problem focused on working adults in urban areas where quality of sleep may be affected because of environmental conditions like light, noise and hot temperatures. The goal of the capstone project to tackle this problem would then be to create an IoT device to capture metrics on both sleep quality of the user and their environmental conditions to perform statistical correlation analysis to provide insights and recommendations.  
2. **Franks Part Here**.

## Feedback from Professor
Dr. Tung approved of the first problem space as our group had much stronger evidence of its need and stakeholders. The problem space itself also seemed more appealing as poor sleep quality is something that many are able to relate to. Thus, our group decided to proceed with the first problem.
